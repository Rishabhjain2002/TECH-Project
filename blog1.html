            <p>“It takes a lot of courage to fight biases and oppressive regimes, but it takes even greater courage to admit ignorance and venture into the unknown. Secular education teaches us that if we don’t know something, we shouldn’t be afraid of acknowledging our ignorance and looking for new evidence. Even if we think we know something, we shouldn’t be afraid of doubting our opinions and checking ourselves again. Many people are afraid of the unknown, and want clear-cut answers for every question. Fear of the unknown can paralyse us more than any tyrant. People throughout history worried that unless we put all our faith in some set of absolute answers, human society will crumble. In fact, modern history has demonstrated that a society of courageous people willing to admit ignorance and raise difficult questions is usually not just more prosperous but also more peaceful than societies in which everyone must unquestioningly accept a single answer. People afraid of losing their truth tend to be more violent than people who are used to looking at the world from several different viewpoints. Questions you cannot answer are usually far better for you than answers you cannot question.”

            <p><b>In a world deluged by irrelevant information, clarity is power.</b><br>It’s impossible to love yourself if you don’t even know who you are. Invest in
                discovering what you believe, value, and like.
            </p>

            <p><b>Say “no” when you need to.</b>Boundaries are an essential form of self-care because they let others
                know that you deserve and expect respect.</p>

            <p><b>Don’t compare yourself to others.</b>Others aren’t better or worse, more or less than you; They’re
                just different. You have value just as you are and accepting yourself means there’s no need for
                comparisons.</p>
            <p><b>Be truly present.</b>Our lives are full of distractions. Many of these things are fun and worthwhile,
                but they can be draining and keep us from truly knowing and being ourselves.</p>

            <p><b>Know and use your strengths.</b>We all have tremendous gifts, but many of them go unnoticed. When
                you’re busy and distracted it’s hard to access these great qualities. Focusing on your strengths will
                increase your positive feelings for yourself.</p>
            <p><b>Give yourself a treat.</b>A treat is something special that you just give yourself. Unlike a reward,
                it doesn’t have to be earned. Be good to yourself by giving yourself treats “just because”.
            </p>
            <p><b>"The future is not something we enter. The future is something we create."</b>This one can be harder than it seems. Some of us as so good at
                self-deception that we don’t even know we’re doing it. Honesty is key in all relationships and your
                relationship with yourself is no different. Clearly, you can’t love your entire messy self if you’re
                lying, minimizing, or making excuses. True self-love means taking responsibility and accountability.ि
            </p>
            <p><b>Let yourself off the hook for your mistakes and imperfections.</b>You’re hard on yourself. You’re
                probably harder on yourself than anybody else. Cut yourself some slack and embrace your humanness.
                Mistakes are normal. Imperfections are part of what makes you, you. </p>
